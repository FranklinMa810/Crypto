# Summary of Papers
1. **Marshall, Ben R., Nhut Nick Hoang Nguyen, and Nuttawat Visaltanachoti. "Bitcoin liquidity." Nuttawat, Bitcoin Liquidity (May 31, 2019) (2019).**

The paper focus on empirical analysis on crypto liquidity, factors that affect liquidity and how liquidity indicate the crash (over 2 sigma daily change). 

Conclusion: 
* currency liquidity itself affect cryptocurrency's liquidity. e.g. USD/JPY will affect BTC/USD, BTC/JPY;
* Within 60-min, return is predictable by using order imbalance and liquidity indicator;
* liquidity declines contribute to future possible cryptocurrency crash.

Methodolodgy:
regression, regression, regression (with variables and Granger test, see variable details in papers). Note that some of them include interaction variable.

2. **Alexander Brauneis, Roland Mestel, Erik Theissen, What drives the liquidity of cryptocurrencies? A long-term analysis, Finance Research Letters, 2020.**
Methodology:
Abdi-Ranaldo spread estimator from hourly transactions data and compare liquidity across cryptocurrencies and exchanges.
